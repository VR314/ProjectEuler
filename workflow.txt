/*
*	Problem #: 
*	Date Attempted:
*	Date Solved: 
*
*	COPY AND PASTE PROMPT
*
*	Answer: 
*/

To solve a new prompt in C# or C++:
	- create new console project
	- set name to 00x 
	- set solution to "Add to Solution"

To solve a new prompt in Python or F#:
	- create a new folder 00x
	- add a source file (*.py / *.fsx)
	- (to run f# scripts) right click the script in the Solution Explorer, then open developer console, then run `dotnet fsi` and pass in the name of the script.

To solve a new prompt in Typescript:
	- create a new folder 00x
	- add a source file (*.ts)
	- to run, run `npm start` followed by the path of the file (ex. `npm start 001/001.ts`)


Commit structure:
MM/DD/YY - LANG 00x, LANG 00x, ... (LANGS in alphabetical order, combine LANGS for the same prompt)
	ex. 05/28/20
		- C++ C# F# Java Py 001
